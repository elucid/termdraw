## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

- Renamed the Paint tool to Brush in the UI, added single-key tool hotkeys (`B` Brush, `A` Select, `U` Box, `P` Line, `T` Text), and made the Line tool render clean line glyphs automatically, including sub-cell Braille for shallow or steep angles.

### Fixed
